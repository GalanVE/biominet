abstract: 'Biological systems respond to environmental perturbations and to a large diversity of compounds through gene interactions, and these genetic factors comprise complex networks. In particular, a wide variety of gene co-expression networks have been constructed in recent years thanks to the dramatic increase of experimental information obtained with techniques, such as microarrays and RNA sequencing. These networks allow the identification of groups of co-expressed genes that can function in the same process and, in turn, these networks may be related to biological functions of industrial, medical and academic interest. In this study, gene co-expression networks for 17 bacterial organisms from the COLOMBOS database were analyzed via weighted gene co-expression network analysis and clustered into modules of genes with similar expression patterns for each species. These networks were analyzed to determine relevant modules through a hypergeometric approach based on a set of transcription factors and enzymes for each genome. The richest modules were characterized using PFAM families and KEGG metabolic maps. Additionally, we conducted a Gene Ontology analysis for enrichment of biological functions. Finally, we identified modules that shared similarity through all the studied organisms by using comparative genomics.'
