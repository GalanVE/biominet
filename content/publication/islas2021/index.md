abstract: 'The dinoflagellate Symbiodiniaceae family plays a central role in the health of the coral reef ecosystem via the symbiosis that establishes with its inhabiting cnidarians and supports the host metabolism. In the last few decades, coral reefs have been threatened by pollution and rising temperatures which have led to coral loss. These events have raised interest in studying Symbiodiniaceae and their hosts; however, progress in understanding their metabolism, signal transduction pathways, and physiology in general, has been slow because dinoflagellates present peculiar characteristics. We took advantage of one of these peculiarities; namely, the post-transcriptional addition of a Dino Spliced Leader (Dino-SL) to the 5′ end of the nuclear mRNAs, and used it to generate cDNA libraries from Symbiodinium microadriaticum. We compared sequences from two Yeast-Two Hybrid System cDNA Libraries, one based on the Dino-SL sequence, and the other based on the SMART technology (Switching Mechanism at 5′ end of RNA Transcript) which exploits the template switching function of the reverse transcriptase. Upon comparison of the performance of both libraries, we obtained a significantly higher yield, number and length of sequences, number of transcripts, and better 5′ representation from the Dino-SL based library than from the SMART library. In addition, we confirmed that the cDNAs from the Dino-SL library were adequately expressed in the yeast cells used for the Yeast-Two Hybrid System which resulted in successful screening for putative SmicRACK1 ligands, which yielded a putative hemerythrin-like protein'
