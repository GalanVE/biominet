abstract: 'Entamoeba are amoeboid extracellular parasites that represent an important group of organisms for which the regulatory networks must be examined to better understand how genes and functional processes are interrelated. In this work, we inferred the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in four Entamoeba species, E. histolytica, E. dispar, E. nuttalli, and E. invadens, and the GRN topological properties and the corresponding biological functions were evaluated. From these analyses, we determined that transcription factors (TFs) of E. histolytica, E. dispar, and E. nuttalli are associated mainly with the LIM family, while the TFs in E. invadens are associated with the RRM_1 family. In addition, we identified that EHI_044890 regulates 121 genes in E. histolytica, EDI_297980 regulates 284 genes in E. dispar, ENU1_120230 regulates 195 genes in E. nuttalli, and EIN_249270 regulates 257 genes in E. invadens. Finally, we identified that three types of processes, Macromolecule metabolic process, Cellular macromolecule metabolic process, and Cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process, are the main biological processes for each network. The results described in this work can be used as a basis for the study of gene regulation in these organisms.'
